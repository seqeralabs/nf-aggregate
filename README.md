# nf-aggregate

Nextflow pipeline to aggregate pertinent metrics across pipeline runs on the Seqera Platform.

The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. Downloads run information via the Seqera CLI in parallel
2. Runs MultiQC to aggregate all of the run metrics into a single report

The primary input to the pipeline is a file containing a list of run identifiers from the Seqera Platform. These can be obtained from details in the runs page for any pipeline execution. For example, we can create a file called `run_ids.csv` with the following contents:

```
id,workspace
4Bi5xBK6E2Nbhj,community/showcase
4LWT4uaXDaGcDY,community/showcase
38QXz4OfQDpwOV,community/showcase
2lXd1j7OwZVfxh,community/showcase
```

This pipeline can then be executed with the following command:

```
nextflow run seqeralabs/nf-aggregate \
    --input run_ids.csv \
    --outdir ./results \
    -profile docker \
```
